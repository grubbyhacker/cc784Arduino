# cc784Arduino
A wifi-enabled ColorCells CC784 LED message board.

# Introduction
Several years ago somebody gave me one of these LED message boards. They were going to throw it away because the programmer was broken. I figured I would do something with it some day. That day has come. In this project I mate an old ColorCells message board with an ESP8266, making a stand-alone wifi enabled "thing". It has a pseudo-REST api, and serves a web page exposing the endpoints and usage statistics.
